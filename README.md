# Welcome to Pawsitive Comedy's AI coloring book!
This is a collection of colorable images for the community, so that people can still be artists, even in the world of AI.
Want to color your own and show your creativity? Choose any image to download from this repository. Load in your favorite editor, print it... use any design tool you'd like! And share it with your friends (or attach it on our latest image-related Twitter post).

*Note that original images are AI-generated using the Magic Media (https://www.canva.com/apps/generate_image/magic-media) and Photo to Sketch (https://www.canva.com/features/photo-to-sketch/) apps in Canva. The challenge is to make them human and hilarious again.
